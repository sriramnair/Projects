# Projects
These projects make use of data science applications. For instance in the Email Prediction project the library used for natural language processing is implemented in order for python to process and interpret text from the english language. For the Youtube Trending Analysis Project, powerful tools within pythons visualization libraries are used to visualize data as well as predict trends. In The Heart Disease Prediction Project a model was created for the purpose of predicting factors that would lead to heart disease. For The Fraud Detection Project a model was created to predict which variables were more linked to payments that were fraudulent.
