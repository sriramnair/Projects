# Projects
These projects make use of data science applications. For instance the Youtube Trending Analysis Project uses powerful tools within pythons visualization libraries to visualize data as well as predict trends. In The Heart Disease Prediction Project a model was created for the purpose of predicting factors that would lead to heart disease. For The Fraud Detection Project a model was created to predict which variables were more linked to payments that were fraudulent.
